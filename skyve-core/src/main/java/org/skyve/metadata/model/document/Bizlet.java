/**
 * A bizlet allows callbacks to be made at pertinent times in the Bizhub server processing.
 * 
 * Event timing is as follows
 * 
 * Bean level -
 * 
 * newInstance() - called after instantiation through the document.newInstance().
 * postLoad() - called after instantiation and population of data store values.
 * preSave() - called before flushing the values to the data store or User press of [Change] button (before document validation).
 * validate() - called after preSave() (and after document validation) but before flushing the values to the data store.
 * preDelete() - called before deletion from the data store.
 * 
 * Form level -
 * 
 * getDomainValues() - called when rendering the pertinent field (including in list view).
 * complete() - called when rendering view widgets with complete mechanisms.
 * resolve() - called when we have a bizId from a view (combo or list membership) and we need a bean
 * preExecute() - called before an implicit action is executed.
 * 					parentBean parameter is not null when adding or editing (zooming) in a grid or lookup
 * 					(ie when ImplicitActionName.Add or ImplicitActionName.Edit is used).
 * preRerender() - called before a rerender is performed.
 * 					This occurs on zoom out operation (data/list/tree/map/calendar/lookup) and during rerender event action.
 * @param <T>	The type of document bean we want to process with this Bizlet.
